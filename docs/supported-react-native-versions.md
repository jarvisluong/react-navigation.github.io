Since `react-navigation@3.x` needs `react-native-gesture-handler` to work, the supported version of react-native will also depends on supported version of [react-native-gesture-handler](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler#react-native-support). Also, `react-navigation@3.x` also depends on the new `React.createContext` API, which is added in `react@16.3.x` (equivalent to `react-native@^0.54`).

If you are using [react-native-screens](react-native-screens.html), you will need to be aware of its own supported `react-native` version too.
